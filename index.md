## Current position

PhD candidate in mathematics at NTNU, working on the NRC-funded project  "Applications of Reduction Techniques and Compuations in Representation Theory".


## Key qualifications
__Research and Analysis__\
As PhD student as data scientist in Lånekassen plus various internships, analysis both individually and in teams has been the bulk part of my responsibilities. As a PhD student, I have gotten experience on doing research on the forefront of mathematics, specifically in the field of representation theory which is closely related to topological data analysis (TDA) and quantum computing.


__Information Technology__\
I have experience applying IT-technologies in practice through multiple internships and temporary positions in the IT-sector. In particular, I have worked with advanced algorithms, machine learning, databases and cloud computing.


__Teaching and Public Speaking__\
Spring 2024 I tought discrete mathematics for first year computer science students at NTNU. I received positive feedback from students and sincerely enjoyed conveying complex concepts in a clear, understandable manner. I have also experience with teaching through my volunteer work in the Norwegian Olympiad in Informatics (NIO), where I have been a board member since 2018.


__Leadership and Teamwork__\
I leadership experience through for example teaching, organizing competitions in programming and organizing conferences. My work in Lånekassen and Itera was fundamentally organized in teams. In my position as PhD student, I have coopoerated with researchers from multiple institutions and nations. 


## Education

`2019-`
__NTNU__ \
I cmompleted my MSc in mathematical sciences in 2021. I've been employed as a PhD student full time since then, planning to defend my thesis in 2025.

`2016-2019`
__UiB__ \
I completed a BSc mathematics at the University of Bergen, with the last year spent abroad on ERASMUS+ exchange to Hannover, Germany.

## Work experience
`2021-` **NTNU** - *PhD Candidate* \
As a PhD student at NTNU, I have worked among other things with computational aspects of representation theory, which is applied for example in topological data analysis (TDA), famous for giving rise to empirically and theoretically sound unsupervised clustering algorithms. My day-to-day work at NTNU has included implementing algorithms for scientific computing in algebra, writing technical papers in Tex, travelling to various conferences and teaching courses for computer science and engineering students.

`Summer 2020` **Itera** - *Intern* \
I worked with explorative data analytics for a large Norwegian fishing industry company on a summer project in Itera. Our team organized data from client in a database, which we queried to discover patterns, synthesise information and visualize data, for example in Power BI.

`2019` __Lånekassen__ - *Data Scientist* \
While studying in Trondheim, I was employed as a data scientist at Lånekassen (Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund). I here learned how Lånekassen had already implemented deep learning in their core business and worked on a project to design the future of AI and data engineering in the organization. In particular, I assisted in implenting proof of concept text analysis solutions on their newly acquired Azure-platform and documenting the work. 

`Summer 2018` __SSB (Statistics Norway)__ - *Intern* \
During a summer project in Statistics Norway, I learned about production of official statistics in general and in particular applications of machine learning in these processes. It was here that I was first familiarized with technologies like R, SQL and algorithms for supervised machine learning such as support vector machines (SVMs).

`2016-2018` __Sonat__ - *Web developer* \
I implemented and maintained the webpage of Bergen-based IT-consulting company Sonat over a two-year period.

## Languages
- __English__ - fluent
- __Norwegian__ - fluent
- __German__ - approximately level C1

## A selection of conferences attended
`Summer 2024` __International Conference on Representation theory of Algebras (ICRA 21)__

`Autumn 2023` __Nordic AI meetup__

`Summer 2023` __BIREP Summer school on Topological Data Analysis__

`Autumn 2022` __Gemini School on Quantum Computation__



## Volunteering and hobbies

`2018-`
__Board member in the Norwegian Olympiad in Informatics__\
While in high school, I competed in the International Olympiad in Informatics and other programming competitions for students. After finishing high school, I wanted to give something back to the organization that had given me so many interesting opportunities. As a volunteer, I am prouded to have helped organizing the Norwegian competitions and to ensure Norways participation in the newly founded European Girls Olympiad in Informatics, which has included sucessfully working to include women in our organization.

`2021-2023`
__Writing on risks in cryptocurrencies__\
I have been following the cryptocurrency markets for years, and have in particular been interested in risk of stablecoins (essentially money marked funds on the blockchain). I have been writing articles on this topic in the two largest financial newspapers in Norway. 


`2019-` __Long distance running__
- Trondheim half marathon, 2024
- Hardangervidda Half Marathon, 2023
- HAJ Hannover Half marathon, 2019
